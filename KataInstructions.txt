FileMover Kata
--------------

Company ABC has a command line utility that is run daily to move log files older than 1 day 
from a hardcoded source directory to another hard coded target directory.

They have a number of requirements they would like implemented, listed in order.

While preforming this kata, it is important you do not read ahead, and ideally, have each of the
requirements written on a seperate piece of paper for the participants so that only the current
requirement is visible at any one time.

Requirements
------------

Are in individual files so that each requirement can be worked through without foreward knowledge of those to come
