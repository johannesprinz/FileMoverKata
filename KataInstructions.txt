FileMover Kata
--------------

Company ABC has a command line utility that is run daily to move log files older than 1 day 
from a hardcoded source directory to another hard coded target directory.

They have a number of requirements they would like implemented, listed in order.

While preforming this kata, it is important you do not read ahead, and ideally, have each of the
requirements written on a seperate piece of paper for the participants so that only the current
requirement is visible at any one time.

Requirements
------------


1. Extend to be able to move a different file extension from the source directory to the target directory by
   specifying the extension on the commandline with "-i=[extension]"



2. Extend so that if a file with the same name already exists in the target directory, it is renamed by 
   appending ".[date].BACKUP" where [date] is the format YYYYMMDDHHSS
   


3. Extend so that the source and target of all file moves are written to a logger
   NOTE: The logger implementation does not have to really log but treat it appropriately and access it
         via an abstraction of some sort



4. Extend so that the age criteria for moving files can be overriden in days from the commandline with "-d [days]"
         


5. Extend to be able to specify the source directory where the files will be moved from on the commandline
   with "-s=[source dir]"
   


6. Extend to be able to specify multiple file extensions using a semicolon delimiter with the -i commandline arg
